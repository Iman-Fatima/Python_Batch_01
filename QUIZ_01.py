# Problem Statements
# Q - 01
# Write a program that will take three integers as user defined inputs and prints the maximum number out of them.
# Solution:-


number_1 = (input("Enter the 1st Number: "))
number_2 = (input("Enter the 2nd Number: "))
number_3 = (input("Enter the 3rd Number: "))

if (number_1 >= number_2) and (number_1 >= number_3):
   maximum = number_1
elif (number_2 >= number_1) and (number_2 >= number_3):
   maximum = number_2
else:
   maximum = number_3

print("The Maximum Number Is", maximum)

# <--------------- OUTPUT --------------->  

# Enter the 1st Number: 55
# Enter the 2nd Number: 78
# Enter the 3rd Number: 95
# The Maximum Number Is 95

# Q - 06
# Write a Python program to sum up two user defined integers. However, if the sum is:
#     Below Zero - Display "Bigger number was negative"
#     Equal to ZERO - Display "Both numbers were equally distant on number line on opposite sides"
#     Greater than ZERO - Display "Bigger number was positive"
# Solution:-
# Q - 07
# Write a Python program to check whether two user defined integers are additive inverse of each other.
# Q - 08
# Write a Python program to check whether two user defined integers are multiplicative inverse of each other.
# Solution:-
# Q - 09
# Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Note :
#     All triangles have three sides
#     An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal
#     A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides
#     An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides
# Solution:-
# Q - 10
